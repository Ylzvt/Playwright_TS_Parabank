#🧩 Parabank Automation Framework

👋 Hi there!

My name is Elizabeth, and I’m a Quality Automation Engineer.
Thank you for taking the time to review the work I’ve accomplished here!

This project represents a test automation framework built from scratch for Parabank, using Playwright and TypeScript.
It’s my first hands-on experience with Playwright, and I’ve truly enjoyed exploring its power and flexibility.

Please feel free to share any feedback or suggestions — I’m always eager to improve and learn. 💫
